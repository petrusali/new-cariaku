			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Kotlin Multiplatform Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: (1) initializing the project with the KMP wizard and creating the required directory structure, (2) configuring Gradle build scripts for shared and platform-specific modules, and (3) verifying the build and running 'Hello World' on both Android and Web targets.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and requires careful configuration of the project structure and Gradle scripts for multiplatform support, but it follows well-documented patterns and official tooling. The main complexity lies in ensuring correct Gradle configuration for both Android and JS/WASM targets, and validating that the initial build runs on both platforms. No advanced algorithms or deep domain logic are involved, but attention to detail is required to avoid setup pitfalls. Industry best practices recommend modularization and clean separation of shared and platform-specific code, which should be reflected in the structure.[1][2][3][6][7]"

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build and Integrate Android Application",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) setting up the Android app shell with Jetpack Compose, (2) integrating shared KMP modules, (3) assembling the UI using shared components, (4) handling Android-specific lifecycle and permissions, (5) creating instrumentation tests for UI components, and (6) validating end-to-end user flows.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple shared modules, adapting shared logic to Android-specific requirements, and ensuring seamless UI/UX using Compose. It requires careful handling of lifecycle events, permissions, and platform-specific behaviors, as well as comprehensive testing. The integration of shared and platform-specific code, along with the need for robust instrumentation and E2E tests, increases the complexity. The subtasks already reflect the necessary breakdown for manageable implementation and testing."

		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend API Client",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) designing and implementing the N8nApiClient class with Ktor and kotlinx.serialization, (2) integrating authentication and configuration dependencies (AuthService, AppConfig), and (3) writing comprehensive unit tests using Ktor's MockEngine for all success and error scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a robust HTTP client with authentication, error handling, and JSON serialization, all within a multiplatform context. The main challenges are correct integration with authentication and configuration services, handling network errors gracefully, and ensuring testability with mocks. While the patterns are standard for Ktor-based clients, the multiplatform and dependency integration aspects add moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Foundation Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) implementing standardized error handling, (2) defining core base data types, (3) implementing configuration management logic, (4) creating unit tests for core components, and (5) implementing mocking for configuration sources in tests.",
			"reasoning": "This module establishes the project's foundational types and error handling, which are critical for maintainability and consistency. The configuration management must be platform-agnostic, requiring expect/actual patterns and careful resource handling. While the patterns are well-established, the need for robust testing and mocking increases the implementation effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI Agent Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) designing the AgentManager and data models, (2) implementing agent creation, (3) integrating tool validation with mcp-integration, (4) implementing agent lifecycle and state management, and (5) writing comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing a non-trivial management system with stateful objects, dependency integration, and lifecycle management. The need to validate tool assignments via another module and to provide hooks for future persistence adds to the complexity. Ensuring testability with mocks and covering various edge cases in agent lifecycle transitions further increases the implementation and testing effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build MCP Integration Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) modeling MCP configuration and execution schemas, (2) integrating and configuring the Ktor HTTP client, (3) implementing the executeTool function, and (4) writing integration tests for executeTool.",
			"reasoning": "This module requires modeling complex data structures, integrating a multiplatform HTTP client, and implementing robust network request logic with error handling. The separation of configuration fetching (handled elsewhere) simplifies the scope, but the need for comprehensive integration tests and correct serialization/deserialization across platforms maintains moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare Back4App Backend and Schema",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) setting up the Back4App application and defining the required classes and schema, and (2) configuring security permissions and uploading a test configuration file.",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a backend configuration and setup task, involving no code but requiring careful attention to schema definition and security settings in the Back4App dashboard. The complexity is low, but mistakes in permissions or schema could have downstream impacts, so a checklist-driven approach is recommended."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Back4App SDK for Configuration Fetching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) setting up the backend-integration module and dependencies, (2) implementing the AuthService, (3) implementing the ConfigFetcher, (4) writing unit tests for AuthService, and (5) writing unit tests for ConfigFetcher.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating a third-party SDK in a multiplatform context, implementing authentication and configuration fetching services, and ensuring robust error handling and testability. The need to mock SDK interactions for unit tests and to coordinate configuration with the foundation module adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Cross-Platform E2E Testing and Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) designing the cross-platform E2E test suite, (2) executing E2E tests on Android, (3) executing E2E tests on Web, (4) identifying and documenting bugs/inconsistencies, (5) profiling AI agent routing performance on Android, (6) profiling on Web, (7) refining platform-specific adaptations and fixing bugs, and (8) conducting final QA sign-off.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task requiring coordination across platforms, comprehensive test coverage, performance profiling, bug triage, and final QA. It involves both manual and automated testing, cross-team communication, and iterative optimization. Ensuring feature parity and performance metrics are met on both Android and Web is a significant challenge, justifying a high complexity score."
