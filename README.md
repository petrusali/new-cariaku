# CariAku Mobile 2.0 - MCP-Enabled AI Agent Platform

This project aims to build a sophisticated AI agent platform that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic tool discovery and integration. It will provide domain-specific AI agents accessible through a unified chat interface across Android and Web platforms.

## Project Overview

The platform is designed to address the limitations of current AI assistants by enabling agents to dynamically acquire and utilize specialized tools through standardized protocols. This allows for a more powerful and flexible AI experience, catering to specific user needs in areas like trading, research, and analysis.

## Key Capabilities

*   **MCP Integration**: Dynamic discovery, configuration, and execution of MCP tools.
*   **AI Agent Management**: Creation, configuration, and lifecycle management of specialized AI agents.
*   **Intelligent Routing**: Routing user requests to appropriate agents via n8n integration and task-based logic.
*   **Conversation Management**: Unified chat interface with context preservation across agents.
*   **Cross-Platform UI**: Consistent user experience across Android and Web platforms using Compose Multiplatform.

## Project Plan & Task Breakdown

The project is structured into phases, with detailed tasks and dependencies managed by Taskmaster. The following is the final, architecturally-sound execution order:
