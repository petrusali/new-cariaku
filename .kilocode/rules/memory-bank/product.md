# Product Vision

## Why This Project Exists

The "CariAku Mobile 2.0" project exists to overcome the limitations of current AI assistants. Standard AI models often lack the specialized tools and real-time data access required for complex, domain-specific tasks. This platform provides a solution by creating a flexible ecosystem where AI agents can dynamically discover and integrate with a wide range of specialized tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Problems It Solves

*   **Limited AI Capabilities:** General-purpose AI assistants are not equipped for specialized tasks that require specific data or APIs (e.g., financial trading, scientific research).
*   **Static Toolsets:** AI agents are often developed with a fixed set of tools, making it difficult to adapt to new requirements or integrate with new services.
*   **Fragmented User Experience:** Users often have to switch between multiple applications and services to accomplish a complex task, leading to a disjointed workflow.

## How It Should Work

The platform will function as a central hub for specialized AI agents. Users will interact with these agents through a unified chat interface on both Android and Web. When a user makes a request, the platform's intelligent routing system will identify the most appropriate agent for the task. That agent will then use the MCP to discover and execute the necessary tools to fulfill the request, providing a seamless and powerful user experience.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Unified Interface:** Provide a single, intuitive chat interface for interacting with all AI agents, regardless of their specialization.
*   **Seamless Tool Integration:** Hide the complexity of tool discovery and execution from the user, making the AI's capabilities feel like a natural extension of its intelligence.
*   **Consistent Cross-Platform Experience:** Ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across both Android and Web platforms, powered by Compose Multiplatform.
