# Project Brief

This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the "CariAku Mobile 2.0" project.

## Core Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a sophisticated AI agent platform that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic tool discovery and integration. It will provide domain-specific AI agents accessible through a unified chat interface across Android and Web platforms, built using Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Key Features

*   **MCP Integration**: Dynamic discovery, configuration, and execution of MCP tools.
*   **AI Agent Management**: Creation, configuration, and lifecycle management of specialized AI agents.
*   **Intelligent Routing**: Routing user requests to appropriate agents.
*   **Conversation Management**: Unified chat interface with context preservation across agents.
*   **Cross-Platform UI**: Consistent user experience across Android and Web platforms using Compose Multiplatform.

## Project Scope

The project aims to create a flexible and powerful AI experience by enabling agents to dynamically acquire and utilize specialized tools. The initial scope involves setting up the foundational architecture, including the Kotlin Multiplatform project structure, backend services, and core modules for MCP integration, agent management, and conversation handling, culminating in cross-platform applications for Android and Web.
